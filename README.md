# Library-Management-System
Library Management System created using Python.

The aim of this assessment was to develop a system for a library that stores details of all the books available, borrower's info and other requirements using the python programming language.
It lacked a graphical user interface since the program was based on console.
The system has the features of tracking the book records, generating the fine if the book is returned late and so on.
